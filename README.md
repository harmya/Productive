# Productive

This is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to manage their tasks and track the amount of time spent on each task. The app provides features for creating projects, adding tasks to projects, and starting/stopping timers to track the duration of each task.

Features
The Productive app includes the following features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the application. Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access to the app's functionalities.

Project Management: Users can create multiple projects to organize their tasks. Each project can have a unique name and description.

Task Creation: Users can add tasks to their projects. Each task includes a title, description, and an optional due date.

Timer Tracking: Users can start and stop timers for each task, enabling them to track the amount of time spent on a particular task. The timer automatically keeps track of the duration and updates in real-time.
